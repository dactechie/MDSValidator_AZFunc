- Use one common schema file for previous_treatment_type and main_treatment_type
- Insert EID based on team
- spit out csv as final result so we don't have 0099 post-code issue (Excel chops off leading zeros)


- Make it easily configurable by non coders i.e. AOD staff
  - Reporting period and start date  (right now have to name the file that way)
  - Team-wise Validation rules
  - Errors-Only output
  - Closed eps only vs Open and Closed eps

- Add EID code to the output data from the team name


- To Test :
  - changes to SLK code
  - Why did some of my tests not catch errors pointed out by Jenny T. ? :
    - gaps in ODC
    - Duplicate ODC
